# Brief

  The repos is to show the implementation of AI and 3D.   
  AI is a trend for the nex-gen vision based technologies.     
  The repos is also included with 3D + AI net such as pointnet, pointnet++, modelnet, VGG16 implementation or framework introduction.   
  The repos is also included with 3D domain implementation or framework introduction.
